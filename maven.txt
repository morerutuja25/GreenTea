========
For promoting a replica in Azure PostgreSQL Flexible Server, you need to provide appropriate values for promoteMode and promoteOption. While the exact values can vary depending on the context, here's some guidance:

promoteMode:

This likely defines how the replica is promoted (e.g., the promotion type or strategy). Common values might include:
Immediate: Promotes the replica to a primary immediately.
Graceful: Promotes the replica in a controlled, graceful manner.
promoteOption:

This could provide additional control over the promotion behavior, such as setting specific options. Potential values might include:
StopReplication: Stops replication on the replica during promotion.
ForceFailover: Forces a failover to the replica (if relevant).

az postgres flexible-server replica stop \
  --name <replica-server-name> \
  --resource-group <resource-group-name>
